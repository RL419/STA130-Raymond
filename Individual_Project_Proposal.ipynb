    "Investigating the association between age and time taken. \n",

    "**Variables:** The age of the participants `(DEMO_age)` and the time taken to complete the survey `(SURVEY_duration_seconds)`.\n",

    "I chose to investigate these variables because old people are less experienced with technology hence may take longer to complete the survey. Also excluding participants that did not complete the survey or completed the survey more than once as they are more familiar with the questions hence tend to complete the survey faster.\n",
    "A histogram would be useful to see which age groups tends to fill out surveys like this as it is easy to identify modes. A box plot would be usefull in removing outliars for completion time, as datapoints beyond the wiskers are outliars. A scatter plot would be useful in this situation as it shows whether or not the relationship between the variables is linear, and the strength of correlation can be determined.\n",

    "**Analysis I Plan to Perform:** By plotting completion time against age and use linear regression model to find correlation between the two variables.\n",

    "**Hypothesis:** If there exists a positive correlation between age and completion time, which means that older people take longer to complete the survey. If the correlation is negative then older people take shorter time to complete the survey. If there is no correlation then completion time is completely independent of age."

    "\n",
    "I chose to investigate these variables because not being vaccinated has a negative connotation, and people might feel less safe to interact with someone that is not vaccinated, so I want to know statistically speaking how true is this statement. A bar plot can be useful to compare how many people are vaccinated and how many people are not, since it is binary. A histogram can be useful in showing how the time spent socializing are distributed. Box plots can be useful to compare the distribution of time spent socializing with neighbours for both vaccinated and unvaccinated, and identify outliars.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis I Plan to Perform:** Use permutation testing. Calculate the difference in the mean hours spent socializing with neighbours between the vaccinated and unvaccinated. Set the null hypothesis to whether vaccinated or not does not affect time spent socializing with neighbours, assume that the null hypothesis is true by shuffling the vaccinated status, calculate the mean hours spent socializing for vaccinated and not-vaccinated, record the difference in mean, and repeat this process many times to get a distribution of the difference in means, then calculate p-value using data that is as or more extreme than the observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis:** If the null hypothesis cannot be rejected then not being vaccinated does not make it more difficult to socialize with neighbour, otherwise if the mean difference is positive then it does make it more difficult, if the mean difference is negative then being unvaccinated makes it easier to socialize."

Bar plots would be useful to show how life satisfaction are distributed for all income levels, as both of these variables are ordinal. Some sort of scatter plot and regression model that determines correlation between the 2 variables would also be useful as a scatter plot demonstrates the relationship between variables.\n",

I'm also told a classification problem is just a regression problem with a categorical outcomes. I still don't know quite what this means or how to do this. I'm told I'll be told how to do this. And I'm told that when I'm told then I'll be able to do it and I'mma do it no problem. Who told me all this? Prof. Scott told me all this. Just like this. That's how Prof. Scott talks. And no I don't know why. If you think you can figure it out be my guest. Dig your own grave if you want to. But just don't say I told you to do it. Prof. Scott told me to do it.\"\n",
