    "Investigating the association between age and time taken. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables:** The age of the participants `(DEMO_age)` and the time taken to complete the survey `(SURVEY_duration_seconds)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to investigate these variables because old people are less experienced with technology hence may take longer to complete the survey. Also excluding participants that did not complete the survey or completed the survey more than once as they are more familiar with the questions hence tend to complete the survey faster.\n",
    "A histogram would be useful to see which age groups tends to fill out surveys like this as it is easy to identify modes. A box plot would be usefull in removing outliars for completion time, as datapoints beyond the wiskers are outliars. A scatter plot would be useful in this situation as it shows whether or not the relationship between the variables is linear, and the strength of correlation can be determined.\n",

    "**Analysis I Plan to Perform:** By plotting completion time against age and use linear regression model to find correlation between the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis:** If there exists a positive correlation between age and completion time, which means that older people take longer to complete the survey. If the correlation is negative then older people take shorter time to complete the survey. If there is no correlation then completion time is completely independent of age."

A bar plot can be useful for showing the proportion of people in each confidence level, since it is ordinal. A box plot can be useful in identifying outliars (people that have too many or too few close friends), and a histogram can be useful for showing how the number of close friends are distributed for each confidence level. A scatter plot can be useful in showing the relation between the 2 variables, and a regression model can be useful in determining the correlation.\n",
